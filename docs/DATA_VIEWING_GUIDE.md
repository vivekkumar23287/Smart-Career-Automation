## 🔍 User Profile Information

### Where User Name & Email are Stored:

**In the Database:**
- User's **email** and **name** are stored in `auth.users` table
- Accessed via `user.email` and `user.user_metadata.name`

**In Your Application:**
When a user logs in, you can access:
```javascript
const user = session.user;
console.log(user.email);
console.log(user.user_metadata.name);
console.log(user.user_metadata.avatar_url);
```

**Custom Display Name:**
Currently, the app uses the name from Google. To allow custom names:
1. Add a `profiles` table in Supabase
2. Store custom display names there
3. Link via `user_id`
